Here are the steps that helped me:

1) (Optional) If you have a CMakeLists.txt file in your project already, but it's incomplete, delete it first.

2) Click on Tools > CMake > Unload CMake Project.

3) Open a source file, and you will be presented with the option of selecting a new CMakeLists.txt file or creating a new one.
   Select create new. You will be presented with a list of files in your project which you can select/deselect for inclusion.
